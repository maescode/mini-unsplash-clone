Using the [Unsplash API] (https://unsplash.com/developers), a mini unsplash clone  - The design uses a staggered grid to present photos from the API, **note** the first row containing the photos overlap the backdrop behind the search bar. - The names of the author and photo location should be fetched from the API - Use a tint overlay on top of the images to give the text good contrast, should an image have a light background. - Implement loading placeholders to provide feedback to users while fetching data from the API - On clicking an image, show a modal of the image in the best resolution that doesn't take too long to download
